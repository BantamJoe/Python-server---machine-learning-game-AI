# Python-server---machine-learning-game-AI

Q learning, python server for a machine learning game AI.

This code represents the server aspect of my machine learning game AI, making part of my coursework assignment. It provides
a way for multiple clients to connect, and train 5 Q matrices simultaneously. 

It establishes a TCP socket connect with the clients, whom transmit state and reward data to the server.
The server then interprets the recieved message, trains the Q matrix (if needed), and then
transmit a new set of instructions for the client.

On closing, the Q matrices are stored into both picke and csv format. The pickle format is used as the loading format,
and the csv format is used for manual readability later.

# To run:

To launch the server, simply run:

python3 run.py
